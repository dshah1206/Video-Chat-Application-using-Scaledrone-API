# Computer Networks Project: Video-Chat-Application-using-Scaledrone-API
Created the project in 2018. It is a simple Peer to Peer Video Chat Application using three ideas:

i) WebRTC â€“ Web Real Time Communication

ii) Scaledrone- A real time messaging service platform for
signalling service

iii) Google Chrome browser- Any WebRTC supported browser will
work .

Implementation:

In this application there are two users ie. A host and a remote host. Remote host is also called as offerer. The application is made using html and javascript. Both the users can individually start their webcams by running the html file in a browser. A hash key is generated every time a user runs the file.

If two users want to get in the same room then the hash key has to be same. ie. to have a two way communication Hash key works as a password that can be shared between two users to get into the same room.

Example:
file:///C:/Users/ABC/Desktop/webrtc-master/index.html#41061d

In the above url: #41061d is the hash key

If the same hash key is used in a different location on a different computer still the network connection will be established.

Thankyou.
